# Maritime LMS

Local Setup Instructions for running the Maritime LMS application on your local machine.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **React**: Frontend library for building responsive UI.
- **React Router DOM**: Client-side routing for navigating between pages.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to the backend.
- **Material UI (MUI)**: For styling components and creating a clean, professional UI.

### Frontend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js APIs.
- **Sequelize ORM**: For interacting with the PostgreSQL database (Course, Company, User-Course management).
- **Mongoose ORM**: For interacting with MongoDB (Authentication, User Management).

### Database
1. Mongodb : User registration and authentication
             Managing user roles and permissions
2. PostgreSQL: Managing Courses
               Managing Companies
               Tracking assigned courses and user progress
### Others:
**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** ‚Äì For secure user authentication and authorization.
**Bcrypt.js** ‚Äì For hashing user passwords securely.
**dotenv** ‚Äì For managing environment variables.

**Special Highlight:** MongoDB is used exclusively for Authentication and User Management because of its flexible document structure and fast access.
PostgreSQL is used for structured data like Courses, Companies, and Course Assignments where relational integrity is important.
